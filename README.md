## Metrics
Two main metrics are inspected on our study: Rouge-L and BERTScore. The former measures 
the longest common subsequence between the ground-truth text and the output generated by the model 
whereas the latter considers both syntactic overlapping between hypothesis  and reference and the context.

However, the extraction of the BERTScore is really expensive, therefore a "small" subsample was extracted
from the proposed datasets in order to evaluate the performances. 

In order to compute the proposed scores we used [pyrouge](https://github.com/bheinzerling/pyrouge) and 
[bertscore](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score). 

## Datasets
As reported [here](dataset/README.md), two main datasets are used for the proposed experiments, 
namely [Financial Narrative Summarisation](http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/cfie/fns2020/) 
and [CNN/Daily Mail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail)).

Due to the computational limitations of our machines, for the experiments we used two different configurations,
called "small", and "large", reflecting the dimension of the extracted sub-samples. Below we reported the 
general information. Further details about the motivations behind these settings and the preprocessing, 
please read section X.Y of the report. 

> _Note: for the same reason, the "Large" dataset from CNN/DailyCNN is a random subsample extracted from 
> the full dataset, containing more than 300k news._

Due to the random extraction of FNS validation set and CNN/Daily subsample, we reported the ids used on each data split 
under the [dataset](dataset) folder.

## Preprocessing

Once the data has been downloaded, it has to be preprocessed (see the report for further details). 
Then, the labels will be extracted according to the selected metric.

1. Split the data (only for FNS)
```
python ./src/split_train_val.py \
      --dataset_path=<path to the selected dataset> \
      --suffix=<trainval's foldername> \
      --reports_folder=<name of reports subfolder> \
      --summaries_folder=<name of summaries subfolder> \
```
2. Preprocess the data
```
python ./scripts/preprocess_text[_dailycnn].py \
      --dataset_path=<path to the selected dataset> \
      --preprocessed_path=<output path of the preprocessed dataset> \
      --filtered_path=<output path of the filtered dataset> [not for daily]\
      --reports_folder=<name of reports subfolder> \
      --summaries_folder=<name of summaries subfolder> 
```

3. Extract labels
```
python ./scripts/extract_labels.py \
      --dataset_path=<path to the selected dataset> \
      --destination_path=<output path> \
      --dataset_split=<train/val/test (list)> \
      --reports_folder=<name of reports subfolder> \
      --summaries_folder=<name of summaries subfolder> 
```

## Training
1. Train Gensim Word2Vec
```
python ./scripts/train_word2vec.py \
      --corpus_path=<path to fullcorpus.txt (inside the preprocessed and/or filtered folder)> \
      --destination_path=<output path of the w2v model> \
      --vector_size=<dimension of the embedding>
```

2. Train extractor
```
python ./scripts/train_extractor_ml.py \
      --data_path=<path of the extracted labels> \
      --path=<output path of the checkpoints and logs> \
      --w2v=<w2v filepath | extenaion .model > \
      --emb_dim=<dimension of the embedding>
```                              

3. Train abstractor
```
python ./scripts/train_abstractor.py \
      --data_path=<path of the extracted labels> \
      --path=<output path of the checkpoints and logs> \
      --w2v=<w2v filepath> \
      --emb_dim=<dimension of the embedding>
      
```

4. Train Reinforcement Learning 
```
!python ./scripts/train_full_rl.py \
        --data_path=<path of the extracted labels> \
        --ext_dir=<path (root) of the extractor checkpoints> \
        --abs_dir=<path (root) of the abstractor checkpoints> \
        --path=<path of the checkpoints and output labels>
        --ckpt_freq=<number of batches between two checkpoints>  \
        --batch=<batch size>
        --n_sentences=<maximum number of sentences per file> \
        --reward=<bert/rouge>
```

## Inference and evaluation 

5. Inference on the test set and evaluate the results according to both Rouge-L and BERT.

```
!python ./src/inference.py \
        --output_path=<path of the model's outputs> \
        --model_dir=<path (root) of the RL checkpoints> \
        --data_path=<path of the extracted labels> \
        --n_sentences=<maximum number of sentences per file>
```

## Pre trained models
In [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tEVT_HRhAPYZaECJis8azTF3yOS4dZRr?usp=sharing) shared folder you can find the pre trained models used for all the main 
experiments reported above and on our paper. In particular there are combinations of datasets (fns,cnndaily) 
and metrics used for the extracted labels and reinforcement learning policies.
